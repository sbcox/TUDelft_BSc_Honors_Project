# TUDelft_BSc_Honors_Project

The aim of this research project is to model the entropy gain due to viscous dissipation (irreversible conversion of mechanical energy to internal energy due to viscous stress) and irreversible heat transfer over a shock wave in fluids of varying complexity. To achieve this, the shock wave will be modeled as a 1-dimensional flow in which the viscous stress and heat transfer are implemented in the continuity, momentum and energy equations. With this model, the entropy production due to both heat transfer and viscous dissipation can be found through numerical integration over the shock, allowing for an analysis of the mechanisms which cause energy loss over the shock wave.

IDEAL_GAS folder contains current code, running main.py will generate shocks for argon, air, water, carbon dioxide, isobutane and R1234ze(E) from Mach 1.04-2.5.
